## About Us

The core development team of `TestableMock` comes from **Alibaba Cloud Â· Cloud R&D Department** (formerly known as **Alibaba Group R&D Efficiency Department**). We not only internally support Alibaba Group's end-to-end project code, testing, and release process of thousands of BU-level product lines, but also the product R&D team of Alibaba Cloud enterprise-level R&D collaboration platform [äº‘æ•ˆ](https://www.aliyun.com/product/yunxiao). As has been deeply involved in the field of developer tools, we are committed to improving the production experience of developers and building a digital R&D ecosystem for enterprises.

The function of this project is inspired by our summary of the pain points that Java developers often encounter in daily unit testing ([external dependence on Mock is cumbersome](en-us/doc/use-mock.md), [private method is difficult to test](en-us/doc/private-accessor.md), [void type method is difficult to test](en-us/doc/test-void-method.md), and [complex parameters are difficult to construct](en-us/doc/parameter-constructor.md)). Its internal name is `Testable`, and was renamed `TestableMock` for SEO reason when it was open sourced, thus the lightweight mock function is highlighted. Don't be fooled by its name, `TestableMock` is more than just a mocking tool.

From the incubation of hackathon, to internal open source, and then to external open source, `TestableMock` has accumulated a group of developer users in the internal and external communities. At the same time, we are constantly improving the functional richness and stability of `TestableMock` itself. According to the current version release process, we usually update the internal beta version containing the `SNAPSHOT` mark internally, and release the official version to the Maven central repository (except for the severe bug fix version) after at least one day of stable used to ensure the update will bring more convenience and less burden to everyone.

Finally, we are relatively optimistic about the discussion in the community about "whether too powerful test assistance is equivalent to condoning code corruption". Just as the birth of `PowerMock` did not really spawn more bad projects, but actually solved many test problems left over by the Java language. Rather than use "code tricks" to test functions indirectly, it could be worth to just remove the constraints, and let the unit test break in all its fury! ðŸ¤

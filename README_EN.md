# TestableMock

Write mock faster, make unit testing easier.

Any test framework, no initialization, no matter private method, static method, construction method, or any other method of any class, and no matter how the object created.
Write a mock method, add an `@MockMethod` annotation, everything is done.

- `v0.7` better anti-refactoring support of mocking, allow quick mock all method in specified class
- `v1.0` all functions are stable, a brand-new start
